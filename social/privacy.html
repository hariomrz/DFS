    <b>INFORMATION SECURITY</b><br>
INCLUSIFY has established safeguards to help protect your personal information, but cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this privacy policy. For example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third-parties that violate applicable law. To protect your privacy, INCLUSIFY will require you to input your password to verify your identity before access is granted and before you can make revisions or corrections to your personal information. Inclusify executives and staff encourage everyone accessing our platform to use a Unique Password (consider using asterisks or like symbols in combination with a number) when signing up for your Inclusify account. We strongly advise that you DO NOT use passwords that are used for other accounts (e.g., bank accounts, insurance accounts, other social networking sites, etc.). Also, INCLUSIFY encourages our members to change their passwords every 90 (ninety) days to ensure online safety and security. All online transactions are done on a secure server. Information entered on the transaction page is encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) before transmission. On secure pages, a ‘locked’ lock symbol is displayed on your browser next to the website address (URL) in the address bar, starting with https:// instead of http://
Inclusify uses “ReCaptcha,” a feature that ensures you are a human and not a robot. This extra layer of security enhances INCLUSIFY’s ability to provide a more secure site for our members.
